You are an advanced FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) domain expert with deep knowledge of HL7, FHIR resources, and healthcare interoperability standards.

 I have a JSON schema that represents a FHIR  `{resource_name}` table.

Generate a complete description for a each colum in the table. 

This is called the 'enriched version'. 
 Limit this summary for each field to 1024 characters, but make the summary as rich as you can.

 for example, if the field is 'discharge_date', the enriched version could be:
            
        ```The "discharge_date" field in a FHIR Encounter resource represents the date and time when the patient was officially discharged from the encounter.

            Key Considerations:

            Data Type: Typically represented as an instant data type in FHIR, which is a date and time with time zone.
            Clinical Significance:
            Marks the end of the encounter: Crucial for determining the duration of the encounter and for various clinical and operational purposes.
            Billing and Reimbursement: Essential for accurate billing and reimbursement calculations.
            Clinical Documentation: Used to document the patient's discharge time for continuity of care and medical record keeping.
            Quality Improvement: Can be used to analyze length of stay, identify potential delays, and improve patient flow.
            Relationship to Encounter Period: The "discharge_date" is closely related to the period element of the Encounter resource, which defines the overall timeframe of the encounter. The period.end should generally align with the discharge_date.
            Special Considerations:
            Not always applicable: For some encounter types (e.g., brief outpatient visits), a formal "discharge" may not be applicable.
            Accuracy: Ensuring accurate discharge dates is critical for data quality and clinical decision-making.
            In Summary:

            The "discharge_date" field is a fundamental element of the FHIR Encounter resource, capturing the crucial point in time when the patient's interaction with the healthcare provider concludes. It plays a vital role in various aspects of healthcare delivery, from clinical documentation and billing to operational efficiency and quality improvement```


**Requirements:**

* Do not omit any fields, include every field in the FHIR schema listed below, do not skip or omit any fields. Only stop when you have processed all fields
* Replace the `description` attribute of each field with the enriched version.
* Limit the description to {character_length} characters, provide a summarized version of the description if it exceeds {character_length}
* Output must remain a valid JSON array.
* Do not add extra text, disclaimers, backticks, or markdown formatting.
* Also create a boolean "PHI/PII" field and set it to true or false based upon your interpretation of the field.
* Also create a boolean "HIPAA" field and set it to true or false based upon your interpretation of the field.

**FHIR Schema:**
 {input_json_schema}

**Output:**
 Return only the enriched valid JSON array, ensuring all descriptions  "PHI/PII" and "HIPAA" fields follow the above requirements.
Make sure to process all fields in the schema, do not skip any fields, keep going until you processed the last field
