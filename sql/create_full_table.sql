OPTIONS(description="This table stores FHIR Encounter resources.  An Encounter resource represents an interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient.  It describes the visit from a clinical perspective and captures information such as visit start and end times, location, participating practitioners, reason for visit, and diagnoses.  Data is stored in JSON format conforming to the FHIR R4 specification (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4).  For detailed information on the Encounter resource, refer to the FHIR specification: http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html.  This table is part of a larger FHIR dataset and can be linked to other FHIR resources using standard FHIR referencing mechanisms.  Regularly updated.");
