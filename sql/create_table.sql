OPTIONS(description="This table stores FHIR Encounter resources.  Encounters represent the act of a patient coming into contact with a healthcare provider or organization.  Each row represents a single Encounter resource and conforms to the FHIR R4 specification (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html).  Key fields include: id (unique identifier), status (e.g., planned, arrived, triaged, in-progress, onleave, finished, cancelled, entered-in-error, unknown), class (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory, emergency, virtual), type (coded representation of the encounter type), subject (reference to the Patient resource), participant (references to practitioners and other participants involved), period (start and end times of the encounter), location (where the encounter occurred), reasonCode (coded reasons for the encounter), and diagnosis (diagnoses associated with the encounter).  This table is part of a larger FHIR dataset and can be linked to other FHIR resource tables using the appropriate reference IDs.  Data is stored in JSON format in the `resource` column.
